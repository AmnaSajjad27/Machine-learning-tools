    "In this assignment you will implement different deep learning networks to classify images of hands in poses that correspond to letters in American Sign Language. The dataset is contained in the assignment zip file, along with some images and a text file describing the dataset. It is similar in many ways to other MNIST datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The American Sign Language letter database of hand gestures represent a multi-class problem with 24 classes of letters (**excluding J and Z which require motion**). The dataset format is patterned to match closely with the classic MNIST. Each training and test case represents a label (0-25) as a one-to-one map for each alphabetic letter A-Z (and **no cases for 9=J or 25=Z because of gesture motions**). The training data (27,455 cases) and test data (7172 cases) are approximately half the size of the standard MNIST but otherwise similar with a header row of label, $pixel_{1}$,$pixel_{2}$….$pixel_{784}$ which represent a single 28x28 pixel image with grayscale values between 0-255.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "A client is interested in having you (or rather the company that you work for) investigate whether it is possible to develop an app that would enable American sign language to be translated for people that do not sign, or those that sign in different languages/styles. They have provided you with a labelled data of images related to signs (hand positions) that represent individual letters in order to do a preliminary test of feasibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your manager has asked you to do this feasibility assessment, but subject to a constraint on the computational facilities available.  More specifically, you are asked to do **no more than 100 training runs in total** (including all models and hyperparameter settings that you consider).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The task requires you to create a Jupyter Notebook to perform 22 steps. These steps involve loading the dataset, fixing data problems, converting labels to one-hot encoding, plotting sample images, creating, training, and evaluating two sequential models with 20 Dense layers with 100 neurons each, checking for better accuracy using MC Dropout, retraining the first model with performance scheduling, evaluating both models, using transfer learning to create a new model using pre-trained weights, freezing the weights of the pre-trained layers, adding new Dense layers, training and evaluating the new model, predicting and converting sign language to text using the best model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPORTANT\n",
    "* Train all the models locally on your own machine. No model training should occur on Gradescope (GS).\n",
    "* After completing the training, upload the trained models' **h5 files** and their training histories along with your notebook to GS.\n",
